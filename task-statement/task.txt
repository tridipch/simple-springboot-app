Create a Spring Boot application based on the following requirements:



- Use Maven and Java

- Create an entity with 3 different types (Spring Data JPA + in memory database)

- Create a rest API for the creation and retrieval of this entity (for example @RestController)

- Validate the input on the RestController when an entity is created (JSR303 Bean validation, @Valid annotation)

- Apply security (Spring Security), by protecting your rest API with Basic Auth.

- Make the health and metrics endpoints available (Actuator)

- Put your code on Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab.



Extra challenges:

- Create a Docker image wich contains your application

- Generate documentation of the REST API with the help of Spring REST Docs
